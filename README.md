The batch file creates a Hash.txt, enter your string in here and return to the CMD.
You can enter the hash algorythm, as example; MD5, SHA256, and so on.
Enter and it will output the Hash for the string you put into the Hash.txt. (Save the file to apply changes.)

If you want to change the hash algorythm, you can restart the batch file or put "/HASH", into the Hash.txt and the batch file will let you change the hash after another enter.
